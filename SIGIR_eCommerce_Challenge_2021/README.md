# SIGIR eCommerce Workshop Data Challenge 2021
## NVIDIA Merlin team solutions


## Objective
This repository holds the **NVIDIA Merlin** solutions for the [SIGIR eCommerce Workshop Data Challenge 2021](https://sigir-ecom.github.io/data-task.html), in which we placed **1st** in the **Subsequent Items Prediction** leaderboard and **2nd** in the **Next Item Prediction** and **Purchase Intent Prediction** leaderboards.

## Competition
The [SIGIR eCommerce Workshop Data Challenge 2021](https://sigir-ecom.github.io/data-task.html), was organized by a partnership between academic researchers and Coveo company. The competition presented two tasks: (1) session-based recommendation and (2) cart-abandonment. The NVIDIA Merlin team competed for both tasks.


## Project Organization

- [task1_session_based_rec](task1_session_based_rec/README.md) - Solution for Task (1) Session-based Recommendation: an **ensemble of Transformer archictectures (XLNet and Transformer-XL)** implemented in PyTorch. The solution is described in detail in our [paper](https://sigir-ecom.github.io/) at the SIGIR eCom'21 workshop.
- [task2_purchase_prediction](task2_purchase_prediction/README.md) - The solution for Task (2) Purchase Intent Prediction consisted in an **ensemble of XGBoost and DLRM** and is described in this [report](task2_purchase_prediction/README.md).
