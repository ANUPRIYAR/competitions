## Steps

1. preprocess raw files: `preprocess.ipynb`
2. categorify the categorical features `categorify.ipynb`
3. train model with frequency threshold 25: `train_thr25.ipynb`
4. load previous model and continue training with frequency threshold 10 `train_thr10.ipynb`
5. load previous model and continue training with frequency threshold 3 `train_thr3.ipynb`
